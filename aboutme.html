                <p>  I worked as national representative for jewelry, and clocks sales, Sales Manager and goldsmith at <a href="https://dimasgold.com">Dimas Gold</a> where I sharpened my skills like comunication, problem-solving, multitasking and I learned to be well organized. That helps me to be a self-driven person and a fast learner. My objectives were to maintain strong relationships with the costumers, expanding the customers network, analyzing competition for maintaining competitive prices, negotiate the price and payment methods.
