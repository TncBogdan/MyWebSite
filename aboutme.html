                    Graduate of the Java Developer Course organized by Software Development Academy for 378 hours almost every weekend for 8 hours per day. During this time, I studied and worked with Java, MySQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Spring MVC, GitHub, Postman, Scrum, and Javascript.
                    In terms of theory, I studied OOP, SOLID principles, REST, KISS, and DRY.

                <p>	Worked as seller, Sales Manager	and goldsmith at <a href="https://dimasgold.com">Dimas Gold</a> where as a leader, I sharpened my skills like comunication, problem-solving, multitasking, and learn to be well organized. That helps me to be a self-driven person and a fast learner. My objectives were to maintain strong relationships with the costumers, expanding that network, analyzing competition, and maintaining competitive prices, negotiate the price and payment methods, national representative for jewelry, and clocks sales.
