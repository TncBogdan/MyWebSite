			<p>	Worked as seller, Sales Manager	and goldsmith at <a href="https://dimasgold.com">Dimas Gold</a> where as a leader, I sharpened my skills like comunication, problem-solving, multitasking, and learn to be well organized. That helps me to be a self-driven person and a fast learner. My objectives were to maintain strong relationships with the costumers, expanding that network, analyzing competition, and maintaining competitive prices, negotiate the price and payment methods, national representative for jewelry, and clocks sales.
